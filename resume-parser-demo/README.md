This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### 1. **Frontend Build Error:**
```
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
**Cause:**  
Your Next.js frontend is still trying to import from `lib/...` paths, which do not exist.  
**Fix:**  
You need to update all such imports in your frontend codebase to use correct relative paths (e.g., `./lib/bullet-points`).  
**This is unrelated to the backend and must be fixed in your Next.js project.**

---

### 2. **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
You want your frontend to send PDF uploads to your new Node.js backend (not the Next.js API).

---

## **How to Connect the Frontend to the Node.js Backend**

### **Step 1: Update the Frontend Upload URL**

In your `resume-parser-demo/src/app/page.tsx`, change:
```js
const res = await fetch("/api/upload", {
```
to:
```js
const res = await fetch("http://localhost:4000/upload", {
```
This will send the PDF to your Node.js backend.

---

### **Step 2: Allow CORS in Backend**
You already have `app.use(cors());` in your backend, so this is good.

---

### **Step 3: Fix All Remaining `lib/...` Imports in Frontend**
You must update all imports like:
```js
import { getBulletPointsFromLines } from "lib/parse-resume-from-pdf/extract-resume-from-sections/lib/bullet-points";
```
to:
```js
import { getBulletPointsFromLines } from "./lib/bullet-points";
```
**Do this for every file in your Next.js project that uses `lib/...` imports.**

---

## **Summary of What To Do Next**

1. **Update all import paths in your Next.js frontend to use relative paths.**
2. **Change the upload URL in your frontend to point to your Node.js backend (`http://localhost:4000/upload`).**
3. **Restart both servers and test.**

Would you like me to:
- List all files you need to update for import paths?
- Show you the exact code to change in your frontend for the upload?
- Help you with a script to automate the import path fix?

Let me know how you want to proceed!
